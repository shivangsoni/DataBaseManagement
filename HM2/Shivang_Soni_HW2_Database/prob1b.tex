% Problem 1b goes below
. \\ \\ \\
$\{B\}^+ = \{ B\}$ \\
$\{B,E\}^+ = \{ C,B,E\}$ \\
$\{D,C\}^+ = \{ D,C\}$ \\
$\{D,E\}^+ = \{ D,E\}$ \\ \\

Try to remove the attributes from the functional dependencies and make sure if the RHS attribute can be reached. \\ \\ \\

From the relation $BE -> D$\\
Try removing E$\{B\}^+ = \{B,C\}$ \\
Try removing B$\{E\}^+ = \{ E\}$ \\ \\ \\
Similarly, From the relation $DC -> E$\\
Try removing D$\{C\}^+ = \{C\}$ \\
Try removing C$\{D\}^+ = \{ D\}$ \\ \\ \\

and also From the relation $DE -> A$\\
Try removing D$\{E\}^+ = \{E\}$ \\
Try removing E$\{D\}^+ = \{D\}$ \\

Means the FD's is a minimal basis.
