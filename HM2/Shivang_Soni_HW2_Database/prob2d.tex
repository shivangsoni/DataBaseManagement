% Problem 2d goes below
Functional dependencies for the relation are:\\
$CT \rightarrow I$\\
$TIH \rightarrow R$\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\
$CTS \rightarrow G$\\

for 3 NF decomposition we require:\\
1.) Check to see if the FD's are in minimum basis\\
2.) Left side is a super key or right side has prime attribute\\
3.) Add all the FD's into the relation\\
4.) Add the relation into 3NF if the current relations does not have super key and remove if any relation is the subset of another relation\\

There are 2 FD's which does not voilates 3NF i.e.\\ 
$TIH \rightarrow R$\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\

All the FD's are minimal basis.\\ \\

Key for the relation:\\
$\{CT\}^+ = \{ C,T,I\}$ \\
super key: $\{THS\}^+ = \{ T,H,S,C,R,G,I\}$ \\
$\{THR\}^+ = \{ T,H,R,C,I,G\}$ \\
$\{CTS\}^+ = \{ C,T,S,G,I\}$ \\

R1(C,T,I)\\
$CT \rightarrow I$\\ \\
R2(T,I,H,R)\\
$TIH \rightarrow R$\\ \\
R3(T,H,S,R)\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\ \\
R4(T,H,R,C)\\ 
$THR \rightarrow C$\\ \\
R5(C,T,S,G)\\
$CTS \rightarrow G$\\


So all the relations R1,R2,R3,R4,R5 are in 3NF.
