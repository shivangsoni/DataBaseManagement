% Problem 1d goes below
Relation is:\\
$B \rightarrow C$\\
$BE \rightarrow D$\\
$DC \rightarrow E$\\
$DE \rightarrow A$\\ \\ \\

Based on the voilators above we decomose the relation as \\ \\

Considering FD $B->C$ for decomposition \\
R1(B,C)\\
$B  \rightarrow C$\\ \\

In Relation R1 B is a key i.e. $\{B\}^+ = \{ B,C\}$ means all attribute in relation R1 is attained\\ \\
R2(A,B,D,E)\\
$BE \rightarrow D$\\
$DE \rightarrow A$\\

As In Relation R2 there is only 1 key \{B,E\} so we need to decompose the relation based on the functional dependency that violates.\\ \\

R3(A,D,E)\\
$DE \rightarrow A$\\


In Relation R3 DE is a key i.e. $\{DE\}^+ = \{ D,E,A\}$ means all attribute in relation R3 is attained\\ \\

R4(B,D,E)\\
$BE \rightarrow D$\\

In Relation R4 BE is a key i.e. $\{BE\}^+ = \{ B,E,D\}$ means all attribute in relation R4 is attained\\ \\


After Decomposing R into BCNF the relations we obtained are R1,R3,R4 \\
