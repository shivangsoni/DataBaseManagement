% Problem 2e goes below

The relations which are in BCNF is just:\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\
other then the above relation all other relations violates BCNF\\

4 relations that violates are:\\
$CT \rightarrow I$\\
$TIH \rightarrow R$\\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\
$CTS \rightarrow G$\\

now the relations are like:\\
R1(C,T,I)\\
$CT \rightarrow I$\\ 
No FD voilates for this relation \\ 

R2(C,T,H,R,S,G)\\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\
$CTS \rightarrow G$\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\ 
Two FD's voilates for this relation i.e. \\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\
$CTS \rightarrow G$\\
Decompose R2 into relation R3 and R4\\ 

R3(C,T,S,G)\\
$CTS \rightarrow G$\\ 
No FD voilates for this relation \\ 


R4(C,T,S,H,R)\\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\ 
1 FD's voilates for this relation i.e. \\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\
Decompose R4 into relation R5 and R6\\ 


R5(T,H,R,C)\\
$THR \rightarrow C$\\ 
No FD voilates for this relation \\ 

R3(T,H,R,S)\\
$THS \rightarrow R$\\ 
No FD voilates for this relation \\ \\

For BCNF R1,R3,R5,R6 holds.

The relation which is in 3NF but not in BCNF is 
R2(T,I,H,R)\\
$TIH \rightarrow R$\\ \\
