% Problem 1f goes below

As all the FD's dependencies for the relation R is a minimal basis \\

Now for decomposition all the Relation must include all FD's and also Relation having Super Key in it\\

As well as we can remove the relation if it is the subset of another relation \\ 

R1(B,C)   R2(B,D,E)  R3(D,C,E)  R4(A,D,E) \\ \\

As no relation is a subset of another relation so we don't remove and no other relation will be added as R2 is the Super Key of the relation R.
