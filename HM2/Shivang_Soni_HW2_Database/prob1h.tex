% Problem 1h goes below
 R1(B,C) \\
 $B \rightarrow C$\\
 $B \twoheadrightarrow C$\\
 here in the above relation B is a key \\ \\
 
 R2(A,B,D,E) \\ 
 $BE \rightarrow D$\\
 $DE \rightarrow A$\\
 $BE \twoheadrightarrow D$\\
 $DE \twoheadrightarrow A$\\
 $BE \twoheadrightarrow A$\\
 $DE \twoheadrightarrow B$\\
 here key is BE as its closure gives all the attributes present in relation R2\\ \\
 
 As from the relation R2 we have violation for all other FD's except BE is we will decompose R2\\ \\
 
 R3(A,D,E)\\
 $DE \rightarrow A$\\
 $DE \twoheadrightarrow A$\\ \\
 
 Here DE is the key for relation R3.\\ 
 
 R4(E,D,B)\\
 $BE \rightarrow D$\\
 $BE \twoheadrightarrow D$\\ \\
 Here BE is the key for relation R3.\\
 
 The relations after decomposition are as follows:\\ R1(B,C) R3(A,D,E) R4(E,D,B)
