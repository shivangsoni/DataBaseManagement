Some issues that were encountered while testing the program was disk quota issues. 
Disk quota issues most likely occured because of doing natural joins with two relations that contained 8 attributes each.
To counter this issue, a limit was set on the problem, such as in 3e.
Program run time also seems to be an issue. Some problems continued to run for more than 30 minutes without a limit.
